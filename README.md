# numerical-matrix-inverter (Learning Project)

This is my first ever Python project, where I built a numerical matrix inverter from scratch, and compare its runtime vs. NumPy's linalg.inv. The purpose of this project is to develop my Python skills by implementing an algorithm I know and have used by hand many times.



This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where I implemented a numerical

matrix inversion algorithm from scratch using Python and NumPy.



\## Contents

\- `numerical-matrix-inverter.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the implementation

\- `invert\_matrix.py` — Python script with the matrix inversion function



Future improvements

-Fix the 0-pivot issue

\-Improve numerical stability
